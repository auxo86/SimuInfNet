# SimuInfNet
This is a simulator of COVID-19 transmission model constructed by pyvis.  
We can visualize the result by adjusting the parameters.

FEATURE
-------
*   modified [SIR model] [1] (use vaccination instead of recovery).
*   designed by multiprocessing pattern for computing efficiency improving on multiple CPUs machine.
*   infectivity variate with time
*   one person usually will interactive with the same people, and this model adopts this rule. However, we determine the contact people number by uniform probability (default between 0.9-1).
*   the probability of be infected determinates by the patient's infectivity. 

OVERVIEW
--------
Here are examples:  
<img src="./SamplePic/VaccOnBorder.png" alt="vaccinate on people not social active" width="50%" height="50%">
<img src="./SamplePic/VaccOnSocialActive.png" alt="vaccinate on social active people" width="50%" height="50%">

## Above are two different vaccination policies.
The 1st one illustrated the effect for vaccination on people who are not social active (for example, people quarantined at home), and the 2nd one is vaccination on those who contact others frequently (for example, convenience store clerks).  

Obviously, the latter can protect more people who are not vaccinated.  

The node color means:  
*   Red: infected
*   Green: vaccinated
*   Blue: neither infected nor vaccinated

The first seed is node 0.  

Node in the middle area means more social activity with other persons and less in the marginal zone.  

This model tells us that we might protect about 85% people by vaccinating 25% persons with [*mRNA vaccines*] [2] in the middle area if we take immediate action in the first 5-10 days.

If you have any idea for improving this project, please donâ€™t hesitate to let me know.
